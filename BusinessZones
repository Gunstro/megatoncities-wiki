1. Data Acquisition
Citypopulation.de gets its data from:
â€¢	National Statistics Agencies (e.g., StatsSA for South Africa, INSEE for France).
â€¢	UN Data, World Bank, Census Bureaus.
â€¢	OpenStreetMap (OSM) â†’ for map boundaries down to very small admin units (wards, districts, etc.).
ðŸ‘‰ Best option for you:
â€¢	Population & demographics â†’ from national census datasets + UN population division.
â€¢	Geographic boundaries (shapefiles) â†’ from OpenStreetMap or GADM.org.
â€¢	These can give you polygons (shapes) for every ward â†’ province â†’ country.

2. Database Design
Youâ€™ll want a relational structure so that everything rolls up into your Mega hierarchy:

CREATE TABLE mega_zones (
    zone_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    population BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    base_price NUMERIC(18,2) DEFAULT 0, -- optional
    owner_id INT REFERENCES owners(owner_id), -- optional: direct ownership
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
